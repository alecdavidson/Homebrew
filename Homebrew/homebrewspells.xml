			<p>Strands of the weave wrap around the target, ripping the target apart into the base elements that composed it. The target can be a creature or an object.</p>
			<p>A creature targeted by this spell must make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures painted into existence make this save with disadvantage. On a failed save, the target takes 7d6 force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points and it cannot regenerate or reform.</p>
			<p>A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to the elements that composed the creature. A non-painted creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.</p>
			<p>This spell automatically reduces a Large or smaller nonmagical object into the raw elements that formed the object. If the target is a Huge or larger object, this spell separates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 5th.</p>

            <p>In your hand or in an open container on your person, you create up to 5 pieces of ammunition or up to 5 darts. The created items are magical for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance or immunity, but have no other special properties. Possibilities for ammunition include arrows, bolts, bullets, and needles.</p>
            <p>As part of the bonus action used to cast this spell, you can use as a material component an amount of gems, gold, or silver equal in value to the ammunition you created. If you do so, the material component is consumed by the spell, and the ammunition becomes nonmagical at the end of the duration. If you do not, the ammunition vanishes at the end of the duration.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create an additional 5 darts or pieces of ammunition for each spell slot level above 1st.</p>
